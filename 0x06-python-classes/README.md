OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:

Just like pytyhon can be written in plain sryle and achieve the required results, an object oriented method is a more tactical way of designing just anything in real world. It assumes the use of classes which tend to encapsulate data and can be retrieved only by getters which serve as methods. This could be synonymous to a high grade super library in real world scenario where only trained staff have the obligation of rerieveing books for users. 
Key: Data is encapsulated.

class class:
    def __init__(attributes)
........and the rsst of the body.


def main()
Object oriented programm OOP is awesome.
